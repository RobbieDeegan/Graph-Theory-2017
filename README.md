# Graph Theory 2017 - Timetabling System
### Project Specification
>You are required to design and prototype a Neo4j database for use in a timetabling system for a third level institute like GMIT. The database should store information about student groups, classrooms, lecturers, and work hours â€“ just like the currently used timetabling system at GMIT.

The use of timetabling systems are in affect in the vast majority or businesses and learning institutions from schools to universitys all over the world. They're what makes a company or college work. Without them there would be mass confusion. The same can be said for a poorly made or designed timetabling system can be as counter productive as no system at all, especially in a learning institution where theres as many variables as students, lecturer or teachers aswell as room to take them. For these reason it is essential to have a well layed out and designed timetable for a system to run smoothly and as efficiently as possible.

**So what does the ideal timetable have to achieve?**
The timetable must be easy to follow and well layed out so that all people using it can understand and use it. Take the GMIT timetabling system as an example. The GMIT system uses blocks on a x,y axis graph with the times of the classes on the top axis and the days of the week running down the left hand side. In my opinion the layout is easy to understand with each block holding information of the room, module, lecturer details and course details. I've never had any difficultty in using this system after three years in the college. 

The system must also work well in use and cause minimal proplems. These proplems invlove lecturers not bring sheduled for more than one lecture, multiple classes being assigned to one room and that the class is free to attend that block. The fact that the college has so many students and modules means this is easier said than done and in the first weeks of a semester can reveal proplems in the system and can be troublesome.
